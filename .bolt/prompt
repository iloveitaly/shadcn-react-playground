Do not write any backend code. Just frontend logic. The backend is handled separately.

When creating mock data, always specify it in a dedicated `mock.ts` file

Load mock data using a react router `clientLoader`. Use the Skeleton component to present a loading state.

Store components for each major page or workflow in `src/components/$WORKFLOW_OR_PAGE_NAME`.

Use lowercase dash separated words for file names.

Make sure to keep a log of what, why and how you did what you did in `fyi.md`. Keep it updated.
