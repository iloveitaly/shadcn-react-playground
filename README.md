# Shadcn Playground with React + TypeScript + Vite

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/iloveitaly/shadcn-react-playground)

Great for using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new) to iterate on UI designs.

All shadcn components are bundled into the repo. This is a plain old react app with no backend.

## Tailwind

[You cannot use v4 with StackBlitz right now.](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13133)

## Bolt.new Tips

* https://x.com/stackblitz/status/1860013597281370565
* Lock all shadcn components in Bolt UI
* Customize [[.bolt/prompt]] to your liking
* Bolt can't sync with Git. The best flow is:
  1. Import this repo into stackblitz
  2. Open in bolt
  3. Iterate
  4. Download as zip
  5. Import into repo and go from there. Once you do this, it's hard to use bolt.
